have your user and password and execute it like `td user_email user_password`

I release this because I have been able to backup all my photos with it and
it has been developed using other open source. I firmly believe that you
shouldn't hack into it any more but to polish a little the algorithm because
you could really end up scrapping all Tuenti.

The filter at the moment works by scraping all your albums, seeing who has
talked there and scrapping them looking for photos where you have been tagged
or commented.

The API I was able to find didn't implement anything else to create more logic,
so it's up to you.

Don't do evil
